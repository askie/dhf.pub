## 🚀 Introduction

**DHF Agent** is a revolutionary browser RPA (Robotic Process Automation) tool. It uses advanced AI technology to understand web pages and help users build automated workflows.

Unlike other AI Agents, DHF Agent adopts an **"AI Generated, Locally Run"** model. Once a workflow is built, it transforms into efficient fixed-code execution, **no longer consuming Tokens**, ensuring both execution accuracy and zero-cost operation. Whether you are a white-collar worker looking to escape repetitive labor, or a developer seeking efficient Web interfaces, DHF Agent is your best partner.

## 🎯 Who is this for?

We have tailored solutions for different groups:

### 1. 👩‍💼 Office Workers & Administrative Staff
**Say goodbye to repetitive clicking and save time for creativity.**
*   **Pain Point:** Repeatedly filling forms, scraping data, and clicking buttons on browsers every day.
*   **DHF Solution:** Tell AI what you want to do, and it will automatically generate the operation process. With the built-in **Task Scheduler**, you can let the computer automatically help you complete report downloads or data entry late at night, and see the results directly when you go to work in the morning.

### 2. 👨‍💻 AI Geeks & Developers
**Zero-cost, high-precision web operation solution.**
*   **Pain Point:** Pure LLM-driven web operations consume a lot of Tokens, and are prone to Hallucinations and instability.
*   **DHF Solution:** Use AI to assist in writing Playwright scripts. Once debugging is passed, subsequent runs consume **0 Tokens**. Transform uncertain AI reasoning into determined code execution, accurate, reliable, and free.

### 3. 🦄 Solopreneurs & Independent Developers
**One person is a team.**
*   **Pain Point:** Lack of resources, high cost of hiring employees.
*   **DHF Solution:** Create different DHF Agent roles (e.g., Customer Service Assistant, Social Media Operator, Finance Specialist). They are like your digital employees, completing their respective web tasks independently in the background, keeping your business running 24/7.

### 4. 🔗 MCP & OpenClaw Users (Ecosystem Users)
**The super tentacle connecting everything.**
*   **Pain Point:** Large models cannot precisely operate web pages, or the operation cost is too high.
*   **DHF Solution:** Perfectly supports **MCP (Model Context Protocol)**. DHF Agent can be mounted as the "hand" of OpenClaw or other AI tools, converting natural language instructions into precise Playwright actions, greatly saving Tokens and improving operation success rates.

## ✨ Key Features

### ⚡ 10x Efficiency Boost
Hand over tedious and repetitive Web operations to DHF Agent to achieve a 10x leap in efficiency. Let machines do machine things, and let humans do human things.

### 🧠 AI-Driven & Assisted Debugging
Say goodbye to tedious code. AI intelligently assists in generating and debugging workflows, allowing natural language to drive process construction. Automated development has never been easier; even if you don't know code, you can get started.

### 💸 Zero Runtime Cost
This is our biggest advantage. After debugging is completed, the workflow can run independently without AI intervention. **No ongoing API Token costs**, achieving true economy.

### 🔒 Privacy First
Runs completely locally, with encrypted data storage. Browser data, account passwords are all on your own device. You have complete control to ensure absolute safety.

### 🌐 MCP Ecosystem Interconnection
Supports standard MCP protocols, seamlessly connecting to external ecosystems like **n8n**, **Dify**, and **OpenClaw**. Break application silos and build super automated workflows.

### 🤝 Workflow Sharing
Supports one-click export and sharing of task flows. Transform your "automation experience" into files to share with colleagues or the community, achieving rapid capability reuse.

### ⏱️ Intelligent Task Scheduling
Built-in professional-grade Cron scheduling engine, supporting second-level timing configuration. Fully automate your periodic work (e.g., automatically clock in at 9 am every day, automatically send weekly reports every Friday).

## 🛠️ Technical Integration (For Developers)

DHF Agent is more than just a tool; it is an infrastructure.

*   **As an MCP Server:** You can mount DHF Agent as an MCP Server for Cursor, Claude Desktop, or other AI Code tools. This gives your AI programming assistant the ability to directly operate real browsers.
*   **Playwright Converter:** It can precipitate unstable natural language intentions into stable Playwright scripts.
*   **API Trigger:** Supports local API calls, easily integrating into your existing Python/Node.js projects.
